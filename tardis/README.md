# TARDIS: Train Delay Prediction Dashboard

## Project Overview
TARDIS is a data analysis project built for SNCF to predict train delays based on historical data. It includes:

- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- A machine learning model to predict arrival delays
- An interactive dashboard built with Streamlit

## Deliverables
- `cleaned_dataset.csv` – Preprocessed dataset
- `tardis_eda.ipynb` – Data cleaning and visual analysis
- `tardis_model.ipynb` – Predictive modeling
- `tardis_dashboard.py` – Streamlit dashboard
- `tardis_model.pkl` – Trained model

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```bash
streamlit run tardis_dashboard.py
```
